# lineageflow-types

This package defines the fundamental types used in LineageFlow algorithms.
These are:

- `Cell`: cell identifiers
- `Time`: time step identifiers
- `Dep a b`: type denoting dependency of `b` on `a`.
- `Scalar`, `Vector` and `Tensor`: typical measurement codomains
- `S1`, `S2`, `S3` and `S4`: for the representation of cell contacts, etc.
