This program is used for the creation and manipulation of triangulations and sets of contacts between cells.

The available commands are:

- `delaunay`: calculation of the Delaunay tesselation of points;
- `neighbors`: extraction of contacts from tesselation;
- `distance`: calculation of distance between contacts;
- `filter-smaller`: filtering of contacts using an upper bound;
- `filter-larger`: filtering of contacts using a lower bound;
- `expand`: expansion of neighborhood graphs;
- `full-graph`: generation of the full graph of cells;
- `global-neighbors`: calculation of global neighbors from local ones;
- `global-neighbors-genealogy`: calculation of global neighbors from local ones, including lineage;
- `merge`: merge triangulations;
- `neighborhood-radius`: calculation of neighborhood radius;
- `neighborhood-proportional-radius`: calculation of neighborhood radius, weighted by global values.
