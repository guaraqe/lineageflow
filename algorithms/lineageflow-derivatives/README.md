# lineageflow-derivatives

This package implements different differentiation methods for discrete cell trajectories.

It also contain the executable `lf-derivatives` with the following subcommands:

- `simple`: naive derivatives;
- `holoborodko`: derivatives suppressing high frequencies;
- `lanczos`: derivatives with polynomial smoothing.
