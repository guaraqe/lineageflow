This algorithm calculates derivatives using the naive method, using the extremities of intervals of a given size to calculate differences.
Since it amplifies noise, it is not recommended for general manipulations.

The only parameter is the size of the filter used for the derivation.
Larger filter sizes improve temporal resolution but reduce statistics.
