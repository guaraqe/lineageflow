This program is used for the calculation of derivatives of measurements over cell trajectories.
For example, velocities can be calculated as the derivative of positions.

The supported commands are:

- simple: naive derivatives;
- holoborodko: derivatives suppressing high frequencies;
- lanczos: derivatives with polynomial smoothing.
