This algorithm calculates derivatives using a discrete equivalent to low-pass filters.
For this reason, it is recommended for the derivation of measurements where one wants to remove high frequencies.

The only parameter is the size of the filter used for the derivation.
Larger filter sizes improve temporal resolution but reduce statistics.
