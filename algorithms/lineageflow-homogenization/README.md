# lineageflow-homogenization

This package implements different methods of homogenization of measurements.

It includes the `lf-homogenization` executable with the following subcommands:

- `spatial-gaussian-vector`: Gaussian spatial homogenization of vector measurements;
- `spatial-gaussian-tensor`: Gaussian spatial homogenization of tensor measurements;
- `time-flat-vector`: Flat temporal homogenization of vector measurements;
- `time-flat-tensor`: Flat temporal homogenization of tensor measurements;
- `contacts`: Temporal homogenization of cell contacts.
