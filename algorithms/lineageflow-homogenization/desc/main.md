This program offers different methods of homogenization of measurements.

The available commands are:

- spatial-gaussian-vector: Gaussian spatial homogenization of vector measurements;
- spatial-gaussian-tensor: Gaussian spatial homogenization of tensor measurements;
- time-flat-vector: Flat temporal homogenization of vector measurements;
- time-flat-tensor: Flat temporal homogenization of tensor measurements;
- contacts: Temporal homogenization of cell contacts.
