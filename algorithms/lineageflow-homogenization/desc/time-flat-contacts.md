This command performs the temporal homogenization of cell contacts using a flat convolution kernel.
The results to this homogenization is a set of cell contacts, possibly larger than the initial one, and for each contact a corresponding connexity factor that indicates the persistence of the contact.

The only parameter is the size of the homogenization kernel used for the homogenization.
Larger values give more homogeneous results, but imply a loss in resolution.
