# Algorithms

The following packages define algorithms both in library and executable form:

- [`tracking`](lineageflow-tracking): generation of spatio-temporal lineages from cell trackings;
- [`statistics`](lineageflow-statistics): global statistics for measurements;
- [`derivatives`](lineageflow-derivatives): discrete derivatives for cell trajectories;
- [`homogenization`](lineageflow-homogenization): homogenization of measurements on time, space, etc.;
- [`triangulations`](lineageflow-triangulations): generation and manipulation of triangulations;
- [`trajectories`](lineageflow-trajectories): trajectories, genealogical trajectories and path integrals;
- [`clustering`](lineageflow-clustering): clustering of cell trajectories;
- [`deviations`](lineageflow-deviations): statistics of deviations of neighboring cells;
- [`forces`](lineageflow-forces): estimation of forces using least-squares methods;
