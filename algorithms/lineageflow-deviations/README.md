This package is devoted to the calculation the deviation between trajectories of neighboring cells.

It also includes the executable `lf-deviations`, containing the following subcommands:

- `all-neighbors`: Calculates the deviations for all cells;
- `born-neighbors`: Calculates the deviations for cells that just divided;
- `sisters`: Calculates the deviations between sisters.
