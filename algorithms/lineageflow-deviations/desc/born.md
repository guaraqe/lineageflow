This algorithm calculates relative displacements and relative increments between pairs of cells.
In this case, this calculation is done for between a cell that just divided and another one within a certain distance of it.

Besides displacements and increments, means squared relative displacements and relative increment autocorrelations are calculated.
These quantities give indications on the nature of the process of deviation between cells.

The only parameter is the radius within which cells are going to be chosen.
We recommend a value similar to the distance between neighboring cells.
