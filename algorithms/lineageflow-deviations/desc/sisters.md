This algorithm calculates relative displacements and relative increments between pairs of cells.
In this case, this calculation is done for between sister cells.

Besides displacements and increments, means squared relative displacements and relative increment autocorrelations are calculated.
These quantities give indications on the nature of the process of deviation between cells.
