This program gives a series of commands for estimating and manipulating forces and stresses.

The available commands are:

- forces: estimation of forces for accelerations;
- stress: estimation of stresses from forces;
- norm: calculation of the norm of forces;
- asym: calculation of the asymmetric part of stress tensors.
