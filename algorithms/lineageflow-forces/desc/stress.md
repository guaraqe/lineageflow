This algorithm estimates stress tensors at the positions of each cell using a coarse graining approach.
These stress tensors are the equivalent in continuum mechanics of forces between cells, but are easier to manipulate.

The only parameter is the coarse graining radius, which determines the spatial region where homogenization will occur.
