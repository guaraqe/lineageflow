This program implements path integrals on the progenies of pairs of cells.
The main use of this is for the calculation of genealogic dissimilarities.

The supported commands are:

- `scalar-pair-path-integral`: path integrals for scalar measurements;
- `vector-pair-path-integral`: path integrals for vector measurements.
