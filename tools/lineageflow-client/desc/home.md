<p>
Welcome to LineageFlow!
</p>

<p>
This interface is divided in parts which are accessible through the menu on the left.
</p>

<p>
 <b>Algorithm Runner</b>.
From there you can lauch algorithms by choosing an executable and a command.
The corresponding inputs and outputs will appear, all of which must be filled.
Finally, you can press the <i>Run</i> button on the top of the page to launch it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Measurement Explorer</b>.
Measurements in the database can be searched using this tab.
For this, fill some fields (not necessarily all) and press the <i>Search</i> button.
</p>

<p>
<b>Processes</b>.
The status of completion of algorithms can be followed on this tab.
When the algorithm is completed, its status will change from <i>Running</i> to <i>Success</i>.
</p>


<p>
<b>3D Viewer</b> .
Measurements can be visually explored from this tab.
You must fill all the fields in the top, and possibly choose a number of different measurements to view before pressing the <i>Run Viewer</i> button on the top.
Due to a small bug now, make sure to choose the value <i>all</i> for the subdomain.
</p>

<p>
<b>Script Run</b> .
Scripts are simply sequences of algorithms where repeated entries are replaced by variables.
They are often more practical to use, but their fields cannot be autocompleted.
</p>

<b>Script Create</b> .
In order to create scripts, one fills an algorithm query as one would for running it, but with the possibility of creating <i>variables</i>.
Variables are created by preceding the name of the entry by the dollar symbol (&dollar;).
</p>

<p>
Good exploring!
